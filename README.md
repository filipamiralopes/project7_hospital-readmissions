# Predicting Hospital Readmissions with Machine Learning

## Project Description
Annual hospital data of a country can give us some really big clues as to what is happening all around and can provide us with important points to which we can develop a new strategy around it (e.g. build a concrete strategy to avoid diseases or any specific health threats).

For instance, it is important to know if a patient will be readmitted in hospital. The reason is that you can change the treatment, in order to avoid a readmission, and therefore costs.
Hospital readmission rates for certain conditions are now considered an indicator of hospital quality, and also affect the cost of care adversely.

Insights:
1) What factors are the strongest predictors of hospital readmission in diabetic patients?
2) How well can we predict hospital readmission in this dataset?
